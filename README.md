# Rich Text to Markdown Editor
### Project Description

This minimalist and practical web app utilizes multiple libraries to create a usable and practical rich text editor that can convert to markdown through copying the markdown text, or by downloading the text as a .md file. I designed it to be minimal, but for all the features to be accessible and visible.

### Why I build this

When I'm typing up a README file, I usually use an online "rich text to markdown" tool to make sure it comes out perfect. I decided to make my own rich text to markdown converter/editor, including only the necessary features including headings, lists, etc. styled in a sleek and enjoyable way!

### Features

-   Rich text editor including:
    
    -   **Bold font**
        
    -   _Italic font_
        
    -   <u>Underline font</u>
        
    -   ~~Strikethrough font~~
        
    -   Unordered lists
        
    1.  Ordered lists
            
    -   Multiple heading options (h1, h2, h3)
        
    -   ~Subscript~
        
    -   ^Superscript^
        
-   Dark mode toggle
    
-   Copy converted markdown text to clipboard
    
-   Download converted text as a .md file
    
-   Text is stored locally in browser (so it persists when you close the tab or reload)
    

### Tools Used

-   React with Typescript
    
-   TailwindCSS
    
-   Vite
    
-   TipTap - a text editor framework
    
-   Turndown - for HTML -> MD conversion
    
-   Lucide Icons from react-icons
    

P.S. I typed up this very README file using this project!
